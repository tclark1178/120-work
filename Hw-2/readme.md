# INTRODUCTION:

I found this homework to be very hard as I am still studying everything and trying to keep up with the flow. I worked my way through it by constant research into Atom, Powershell, GitHub and git.

## OVERVIEW OF WORK:

studying early morning to late in the afternoon on the assignment. I found some useful info on [youtube when it came to Powershell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHrGresKu2w&t=974s)

## PROBLEMS:

One of the PROBLEMS I had was asking for help when I didn't even know where to start on the PROBLEM or if there was one. ..*A lot of user error.*

## Breakthroughts:

opening a paint in Powershell.

## Future WORK:

Try to keep up and but still give time to detail of coding.

##CONCLUSION:

*Mostly re-reading over this week assignment again and again.*
