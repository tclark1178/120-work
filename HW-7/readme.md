What this code is doing is making a ball bounce around the canvas when we click the mouse.
The math setup for the ball to bounce around the canvas is set at random within the canvas.
the ellipse that makes the ball will go forever as long as it is set within the draw function.
thus giving us its pattern.

by changing the x and y speed from 1 to 8 you get a diffirent pattern.
the ball changes its course by mixing up its speed from 1 to 8.
