This homework was a struggle as learning more into functions was confusing
arrays being many variables together was interesting
 to say the least.  

Thanks to Michael he gave me some good advice on the topic that the homework
didn't explain to well.

I'm sure as I keep working with functions and arrays will get the hang of them
soon.
