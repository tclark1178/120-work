The idea of this abstract was not only a homage to early comic art but the carefree years of childhood.
Like childhood (like with this abstract) life starts out simply but over time it gets more complicated and clouded.
I had a lot of fun with this project as it was challenging with trail and error outcomes.
It was to start out much simpler but I added to it to for more passion and spark.
One of my struggles was having to look over the reading again and again.
I hope to create more art like this in the semester.
