DISCLAMER! this is not my orginal code.
Its from page 158 of the textbook by Lauren McCarthy called the JitterBug object.

I had a great struggle with writing this homework as it was hard to wrap my mind around making an algorithm
So for an educational purpose I modified the JitterBug code from the book to help me understand the process better.
