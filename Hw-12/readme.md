OOP is still a struggle for me however I'm now starting to understand how it is
easier to work with than the first way of programming.

This class and programming in general has taught me a lot about thinking differently
and looking at things differently.

Ill keep working at it to get the hang of it and I look forward to more OOP in
the future.
